2. Hibernate 5.2 :  It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Also used to reduce lines of code by maintaining object-table mapping itself and return result to application in the form of Java objects.

3. Database: MySQL is an open source relational database which we have used to store all relevant data such as user details, product details, order details, etc.
